<p>The most important, and the rule that is applied to all writings is to be clear and comprehensible. The feedback can be written in point form or paragraph. One of the aims of the peer feedback is to help the peer improve their work. This can only be reached if they understand what the feedback is referring. In order to make the feedback useful, where the improvements can be done should be clearly pointed out and detailly explained. For example, referring to the exact paragraph or line when giving suggestions. Feedback should be in plain English and Jargon can be used only if it is taught in class. The feedback provides a chance to learn from peer and to figure out our own shortcomings, therefore, we should treat it seriously and do not hesitate the help others. 
<p>When giving feedback, the recommendations should be feasible. Do not build a castle in the air. The suggestions are supposed to come from the knowledge we have learnt in class. You are more than welcome to learn advanced skills if you would like to, and you could discuss it with your classmates or professor when there is a chance, but it is not appropriate to introduce those skills in feedback. 
<p>Despite of the attributes mentioned above, the most valuable feedback to me is the one looks at the problem from a different perspective to mine and can stimulate my thoughts. Furthermore, it helps enrich the content of my writing.

<p>In conclusion, a good feedback should be detailed, feasible and comprehensible instead building castle in the air. From my perspective, the most valuable feedback should inspire my thinking as well.
